if you see this ,I thought my home page is successfully.

this theme is power by [hexo](hexo.io) , you can click this link to find more info that you need.

it took me about a month to make it,full time is about 50 hours.

#### schedule:

**1st week**: find templates on GitHub([tanwubin.github.io](tanwubin.github.io)) ,actually it is a nice template ,but is seems a little obsolete . But it made me chaos on building my pages. But at the stage it helps me to know how to build my page. And know how to do,what to do.

**2nd~3rd week**: at the second stage I got know [hexo](hexo.io) 主题 ,以及[NexT](http://theme-next.iissnan.com/) 主题，I start to learn how to build my page on [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/) ,even thought they just teach how to build the model on NexT . Here I will show how I build my pages. Including modified the base model that hexo provided.

**4th week**: at last, I fill my own pages with my head :face_with_head_bandage::face_with_head_bandage::face_with_head_bandage: .





thanks to hexo,thanks to [tanwubin](tanwubin.github.io) ,thanks to the ups on bilibili,thanks to [龙哥盟](flygon.net) ,and finally me.
